### Practical preparations:

 To be finished before mid of Feb (Mon 15.02.2016):

- List of GEF4530 students and emails (KK)
- Login for students and Hans at Notur NN1000K & Norstore NS1000K for hexagon (AC)
- Pretests for running CAM5 om hexagon: computer time, model resolution  (HB)
- Run control run within Notur NN1000K and Norstore NS1000K projects (HB)
- Preparation for running the model: script how to set-up CAM on hexagon, prepare surrounding (AC)
- Provide plotting scripts (phython/ matlab) and data analysis tools (cdo/nco) (HB)
- List of interesting and feasible experiments (KK, HB, AC)
- Write tutorial (see CAM tutorial) (HB, AC, KK)
- Apply for access to AC, HB, KK for GEF4530 webside (KK)
- Dry runs (all)

### Planned practicals:
